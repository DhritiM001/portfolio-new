                        <p>In the world of machine learning and data science, probability distribution plays a
                            particularly important role and the core of the probability distribution concept is focused
                            on Normal Distributions.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Here we aim to explain the concept of Normal Distribution in the simplest possible way for
                            easy and efficient understanding as well as explain the concept with the help of an example.

                        <p>If you ask enough people about their shoe size or height you will come up with a graph that
                            is shaped like a bell and this is the Normal Distribution curve, also known as the Gaussian
                            distribution (named after the genius Carl Friedrich Gauss). It is a symmetric distribution
                            of probability over the mean, indicating that data near the mean occur more often than the
                            data far away from the mean.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Now, to understand Normal Distribution it is firstly important for us to know the concept of
                            probability distribution since it forms the base for Normal Distribution.</p>

                        <p>A probability distribution is a function that describes the likelihood of obtaining the
                            possible values that a random variable can assume. Let us break this down into simpler
                            terms. Suppose we want to predict a variable accurately then we must do the following:</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>1. First, we need to understand the underlying behaviour of our target variable. This means
                            we need to determine the possible outcomes of our target variable and check if the
                            underlying outcomes are discrete/distinct values or continuous/infinite values. Let us take
                            the example of a die. In this the first step would be to take up any value from 1 to 6
                            (discrete values).</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>2. Step two would include assigning probabilities to the events. The higher the probability,
                            the more likely it is for the event to occur.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Now, if we can start repeating this experiment for a large number of times and start noting
                            the values we retrieve for the variable then we can group all the values into categories and
                            for each category, we can start recording the number of times the variable had the value of
                            the category.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>For example, we can throw a dice 10000 times and can create 6 categories as there are 6
                            possible values that a dice can take. After every throw, we can record the number of
                            occurrences for each value and note it in the respective category.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>We can then plot a line-chart where the values of the categories would be the x-values, and
                            the values of the y-axis would represent the category value frequency. We will note that it
                            is the shape of a curve. This curve is known as the curve of the probability distribution,
                            and the probability of obtaining the target variable value is known as the variable’s
                            probability distribution.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Once we understand how the values are distributed then we can start estimating the
                            probabilities of the events (even by using formulas). This results in better understanding
                            of the behaviour of our target variables. The probability distribution’s key parameters are
                            the moments of the sample such as mean (average of the sample), standard deviation (shows
                            the variation or dispersion there is from the average), skewness (measures the symmetry of a
                            distribution), and kurtosis (measures the thickness of the tail ends of a distribution).</p>

                        <p>Out of the many probability distributions, the most widely used probability distribution is
                            known as “normal distribution”. So, let us understand normal distribution now.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>As mentioned before, if we plot the probability distribution and it forms a bell-shaped curve
                            then the variable has normal distribution. Here, the mean, mode and median of the sample are
                            equal.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Some more examples whose variables are close to normal distribution are: <br>

                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Moreover, there are many variables around us which are normal with a x% confidence; x less
                            than 100.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>As mentioned before a normal distribution is a distribution that is solely dependent on two
                            parameters of the data set: mean and the standard deviation of the sample, both of which
                            have been explained above.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>From a large variety of distributions, normal distribution is one of the simplest which makes
                            it extremely easy for statisticians and hence any variable that exhibits normal distribution
                            is feasible to be forecasted with higher accuracy.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Now, an amazing feature of these distributions is that once you find the probability
                            distributions of most of the variables in nature then they all approximately follow a normal
                            distribution. Normal distribution is simple to explain because the mean, mode, and median of
                            the distribution are equal and the skewness is zero. Moreover, we only require the mean and
                            standard deviation to explain the entire distribution.</p>

                        <p>Let us consider that there is a random variable, such as the height of a sample of human
                            population has a mean m and standard deviation s. Then, we would start gathering samples to
                            represent the random variable let’s say ‘H’ for height, where each sample would have its own
                            mean. Now, following the same steps as probability distribution, we would start repeating
                            the experiment for more samples and start calculating the mean of each sample. After doing
                            this, we will notice that the samples mean would have its own probability distribution as
                            the number of samples are increased. This distribution will ultimately end up being very
                            close to normality. Take the dice for example, here we see a triangle like shape which can
                            be considered as normal distribution just with two dice but as we increase the samples to
                            lets say 5 dice, it will get closer to normality and we will be able to see a more distinct
                            normal distribution curve. This is known as the <a href=""

                        <br>
                        <p>Coming to the main characteristics of a typical normal distribution density function: <br>
                            <span> 1. Mean is the centre of the curve. This is the highest point of the curve as most of
                                the points are at the mean.</span><br>
                            <span> 2. There is an equal number of points on each side of the curve (because of which
                                skewness is zero).</span><br>
                            <span> 3. The total area under the curve is the total probability of all the values that the
                                variable can take which is therefore 100%.</span><br>
                            <span> 4. Approximately 68.2% of all of the points are within the range -1 to 1 standard
                                deviation.</span><br>
                            <span> 5. About 95.5% of all of the points are within the range -2 to 2 standard
                                deviations.</span><br>
                            <span> 6. About 99.7% of all of the points are within the range -3 to 3 standard
                                deviations.</span><br>
                        </p>

                        <p>This is known as the empirical rule. This allows us to easily estimate how volatile a
                            variable is and to some level the prediction of how volatile it would be. For example, there
                            is a 68.3% chance that the value of the variable will be within the white range which on
                            further giving it values can become more accurate.</p>

                            <span class="blog-info top_15 bottom_30">This is the probability density function of the
                                normal distribution</span>
                        </figure>
                        <p>The probability density function is the probability of continuous random variable taking a
                            value. As we know, normal distribution is a bell-shaped curve where mean=mode=median.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>So, if you plot the probability distribution curve using the calculated probability density
                            function then the area under the curve for a given range gives the probability of the target
                            variable being in that range.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>This probability distribution curve is based on a probability distribution function which
                            itself is computed on many parameters such as mean, or standard deviation of the variable.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>We could use this probability distribution function to find the relative chance of a random
                            variable taking a value within a range. For example, we could record the daily returns of a
                            stock for lets say two years and group them into their appropriate categories and then find
                            the probability of the stock making 20–40% gain in the future. Here is an example of the
                            same:</p>
                        <br>
                        <figure class="bottom_60" style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
                            <img src="img/Blog 4 Image 7.webp" alt="">
                            <span class="blog-info top_15 bottom_30">Larger the standard deviation, more volatility in
                                the sample.</span>
                        </figure>
                        <p>Here, we calculated the return percentage of the stock by dividing the current month’s price
                            by the prior month’s price and subtracting the number 1 this result before converting it
                            into percentage. We, then calculated its mean and standard deviation and further on used the
                            formula for normal distribution on excel and then plotted its graph. We see that it forms a
                            normal distribution curve from which we can predict the gain %.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>One way to make our sample distribution is Linear Transformation which focuses on computing
                            Z-scores. The formula and working for the same is shown in our stock returns example.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Problems: The normal distribution is overused in a lot of predictive projects, mainly because
                            it is simple and well-understood but it also has some flaws like we cannot assume that the
                            stock price follows normal distribution as the price cannot be negative (we follow log of
                            stock price so that its value is never below zero).</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>However, the daily returns can be negative as seen in our example thus, the returns can at
                            times follow a normal distribution. So, one cannot always assume that the data we have will
                            follow normal distribution without further analysing it. Thus, the most important point to
                            note is to understand and identify your data before you make the curve.</p>
